            <p>Trinity Heights Respite Care is a non-profit organization operating in south central Kansas, providing essential care to children with developmental disabilities at a low-to-no-cost for clients. The organization sought to revitalize their web presence to better reach a younger generation of parents. </p>

            <h2>The Context and Challenge:</h2>    
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>As a web development studio, we were engaged to work on this project and decided to implement a WordPress platform for Trinity Heights Respite Care. We provided them with a new, modern design and several dedicated pages to support their mission, including an "About" page and a "How to Support" page. Previously, the organization did not have the capability to accept donations through their website, but with the integration of Stripe API, they are now able to accept donations and payments online. </p>

            <h2>The Process:</h2>    
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>We began the project by holding a meeting with the client to determine their specific needs and identify suitable themes for the website. Our designer then worked on creating a visually appealing design, which I implemented. This was my first project in a WordPress environment and I learned how the web development process can vary depending on the technology stack. </p>

            <h2>Self-Reflection:</h2>        
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>As this was also the first project for my designer and I as a web development studio, we are currently performing a design critique of the website and updating it to reflect the knowledge and experience we have gained since the project was completed in June 2022. </p>

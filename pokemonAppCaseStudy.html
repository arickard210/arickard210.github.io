            <h2>Background:</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>The development of the Guess That Pokemon! App aimed to address the problem of creating an engaging and interactive guessing game that utilizes data from an API to showcase various Pokemon and allows users to make guesses about them. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading-container">
            <h2>Implementation:</h2>    
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>The solution implemented was the creation of a React application that fetches data from an API and stores it in the App component. The data is then passed down through props to child components that display the Pokemon, and feature input fields and buttons for users to make guesses. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading-container">
            <h2>Design:</h2>    
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>The design of the application was mobile-first, optimized for mobile devices and was user-friendly. User testing was conducted to ensure the design met user expectations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading-container">
            <h2>Development:</h2>    
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>The application was developed by first creating child components that rendered static data, then passing data with state held by each child and finally moving the state to the parent component to create a seamless flow of code that ensured functionality was not lost. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading-container">
            <h2>Outcome:</h2>    
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>The Guess That Pokemon! app has two states depending on the guess passing or failing the verification check. The app is a successful implementation of a React application that consumes data from an API and allows for user interaction. However, the project could be improved by adding in a score tracking feature, a timer to measure the number of Pokemon that can be guessed in a minute, and maintaining a ‘Pokedex’ that stores information about each Pokemon guessed correctly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading-container">
            <h2>Timeline:</h2>        
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>The app was developed in three days. Day one was spent researching and understanding React, and how to render static components on the screen. Day two was spent lifting up state. Day three was spent working with users to implement things like confirmation of correct/incorrect guesses. This project holds a special place in my heart because it combined coding with my childood!</p>

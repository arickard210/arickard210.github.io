        <div class="body-container">
            <p>The 'Guess that Pokemon' app was developed to address a common challenge faced by junior full stack developers: showcasing creative and personal projects that demonstrate proficiency in key concepts of the React environment, such as state management and passing data to child components and API consumption. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading-container">
            <h2>Implementation:</h2>    
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p> The application was built in several stages: first, data was hard-coded in to display data from the resources folder, 2) functions were written to fetch data from the Pokemon API and the hardcodes were switched to the API call, 3) state data was lifted to the parent App function and passed down to components to improve app consistency. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading-container">
            <h2>Design:</h2>    
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>The application was optimized for a mobile screen, with a focus on pictures and graphics rather than text. User testing was conducted to ensure the design met user expectations and provided an optimal user experience. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading-container">
            <h2>Outcome and Self-Reflection:</h2>    
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>This project successfully demonstrates the ability to consume APIs and pass data through nested components. However, there are several areas for improvement. One potential improvement would be to add a score-keeping mechanism and timer, enabling players to achieve high scores. Additionally, incorporating databases and user authentication would allow for the development of a "pokedex" for each user to guess every Pokemon correctly. Finally, providing more data for hints could ease non-Pokemon players into having an enjoyable experience on the app. </p>
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="heading-container">
            <h2>Timeline:</h2>        
        </div>
        <div class="body-container">
            <p>The app was developed in three days. Day one was spent researching and understanding React, and how to render static components on the screen. Day two was spent lifting up state. Day three was spent working with users to implement things like confirmation of correct/incorrect guesses. This project holds a special place in my heart because it combined coding with my childood!</p>
